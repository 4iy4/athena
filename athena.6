.SH NAME
athena \- a chess engine
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Athena
is a UCI chess engine that can be used along with a chess GUI that
supports the UCI protocol.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Athena
can be used to analyze chess positions to find the best move possible,
or the best move it was capable of recognizing. It is recommended the use of a
chess GUI that supports the UCI (Universal Chess Interface), the protocol
.B Athena
uses to communicate with other chess programs. A chess GUI can display
the information returned by a chess engine in a more user friendly way, and it
is also possible to play against the engine, where the best move found is
supposed to be played by the GUI.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.B Athena
should normally return 0, it only returns something else if something goes
horribly wrong and this might need to be filed as a bug.
